# ID-Study---SONIC-PI

This is the Independent Study I took with Patrick Pagano, I focused majorily on Sonic Pi as this was the program that resonated with me the most.
In Sonic Pi I was assigned with exploring the software and seeing what I could create, basically the Great Pagano mindset of "Explore, Learn, Make
Awesome Shit!" So here is a folder with 4 text files who's contents can be copy and pasted onto a Sonic Pi Buffer and be played and listened to.

This is being submitted for a course grade as part of my Final Explorations for this Independent Study.
